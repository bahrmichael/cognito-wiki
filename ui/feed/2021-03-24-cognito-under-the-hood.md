Have you ever implemented a user database and authentication layer yourself? There are many things to get right: Hashing and salting passwords, multi-factor authentication, brute force attacks, and many more. [That’s why I recommend using a production-ready service instead of building authentication yourself. That’s what Amazon Cognito is all about.](https://cloudonaut.io/cognito-under-the-hood/)
