The password reset function of AWS Cognito allows attackers to change the account password if a six-digit number (reset code) sent out by E-mail is correctly entered. 

[This article](https://www.pentagrid.ch/en/blog/password-reset-code-brute-force-vulnerability-in-AWS-Cognito/) shows how it was done. 

The issue was fixed by AWS on 2021-04-20.
