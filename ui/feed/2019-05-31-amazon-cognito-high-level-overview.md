[This tech talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAR4ZHP8DEg) will start by showing how you get going with Cognito, adding it to your application through frameworks like AWS Amplify. We'll then follow up with showing how Amazon Cognito integrates with the broader set of AWS services including Amazon API Gateway, AWS Application Load Balancer, AWS Security Token Service and others to provide you with a complete authentication and authorization solution for your application.

Learning Objectives:
 - Learn how to initially configure Cognito and add it to an application
 - See how Cognito normalizes native and federated identities
 - Discover how Cognito integrates easily with adjacent AWS services
