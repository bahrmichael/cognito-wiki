[I am going to use AWS Cognito to manage user login and authentication](https://medium.com/omisoft/creating-flutter-app-with-aws-serverless-backend-part-1-social-login-35143884d4c7). In this scenario, my app needs to communicate with Cognito directly to obtain an authentication token and after that, I will add this token to every request send to my backend.
