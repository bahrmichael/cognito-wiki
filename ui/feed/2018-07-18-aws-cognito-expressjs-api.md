In recent articles, I have shown [how to create a login screen using AWS Cognito](https://ian-says.com/articles/aws-cognito-user-pool/), and [validate the resulting JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://ian-says.com/articles/jwt-parsing-with-javascript/) using Javascript. 

[This article brings those elements together](https://ian-says.com/articles/aws-cognito-expressjs-api/), showing how we can use our AWS Cognito login screen to protect access to an API being served from an ExpressJS application.
