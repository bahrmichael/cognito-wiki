[In this post](https://cloudbyexample.io/part-1-aws-cognito-user-pool-the-basics/), I want to tell you a few things about User Pools. I will describe what a User Pool is and how it works in separation (without connection to an Identity Pool). I will create a simple pool and use AWS CLI to sign a user up, in, and out. I will also describe what it means to sign a user in and what's all about those tokens you receive at the end of the sign-in process. You will also find here a CDK application you can deploy to follow along.
