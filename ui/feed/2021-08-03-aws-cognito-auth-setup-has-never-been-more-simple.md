[In this article](https://lakshyajit165.medium.com/aws-cognito-auth-setup-has-never-been-more-simple-f53fb170eeac) we’ll setup an authentication server which will handle the basic authentication stuff that pretty much every web/mobile app out there needs to have. We’ll also be using AWS SES (Simple Email Service) to send OTPs to users.
