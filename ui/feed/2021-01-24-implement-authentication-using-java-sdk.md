[This tutorial will show you how to implement the authentication flow of AWS Cognito using Java SDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaFbOJWhE50).

We are going to learn how to make an integration with Amazon Cognito using the Amazon Web Services software development kit (AWS SDK) for Java by providing some code samples and documentation. We are going to leverage AWS to integrate authentication and authorization into a Java web application, in addition to using groups in Amazon Cognito user and identity pools to obtain temporary identity and access management (IAM) credentials in the application.
