[I explain how the basic authentication with a username and password works](https://cloudbyexample.io/part-2-aws-cognito-user-pool-authenticating-with-username-and-password/). I explain what aliases are and how we can use them. I also show how the account confirmation/verification works. The examples will be explained using an actual User Pool we will be able to create using CDK. All of the source code is available on GitHub. As always, the repository contains a Docker configuration for Visual Studio Code.
