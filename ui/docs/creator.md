Hi, my name is Michael and [I blog about serverless](https://bahr.dev)! 
I started this project for making it easier
to find the right AWS Cognito guides for your use case, be it from
AWS or community sources. For now the goal is to aggregate the links
to all the great content out there. If you want to improve this
project, or build your own from the resource we provide here, please
give it a go!
