To submit a new article you can [create a pull request](https://github.com/bahrmichael/cognito-wiki/pulls) where you 
add a new file to the `/feed` folder. Copy and paste one of the existing entries, and adjust it to your liking.
You decide if you want to submit your whole article, or just a description snippet and a link to your blog. If you
didn't create the content yourself, then please only write a short description.
